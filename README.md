# Generator in JS
Using generator in this projects make it possible to process batch data as iterable.

Without generator, we only get feedback after the processing complete (in this project, in the console). With generator, we can get feedback after each batch processed.

## Requirements
NodeJS 18.4.0

## How to run
1. Clone the repository

2. Run the product server
```
npm run start:product
```

3. Run the cart server
```
npm run start:cart
```

4. Run the client
```
npm run start:client
```
